# UserDashboard

UserDashboard is a web-based application designed to provide users with a personalized dashboard experience. This project is built using React and integrates various user interface components.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RohitRathiii/UserDashboard.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd UserDashboard
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

   The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is used to bypass peer dependency checks and force npm to resolve dependencies as it did in npm versions 4 through 6.

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the project in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
